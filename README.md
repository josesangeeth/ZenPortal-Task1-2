HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the underlying protocol of the World Wide Web. Developed by Tim Berners-Lee and his team between 1989-1991

-> The initial version of HTTP had no version number. It has been later called 0.9 to differentiate it from the later versions.
   HTTP/0.9 is extremely simple: requests consist of a single line and start with the only possible method GET followed by the path to the resource (not the URL as both    the protocol, server, and port are unnecessary once connected to the server).

-> The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol in the Internet protocol suite model for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information      systems.
   HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access,    for example by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser.
   
   **Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2**
   
   HTTP 1.1 :
   
   Developed by Timothy Berners-Lee in 1989 as a communication standard for the World Wide Web.
   In this process, a client sends a text-based request to a server by calling a method like GET or POST. 
   In response, the server sends a resource like an HTML page back to the client.
   For example, letâ€™s say you are visiting a website at the domain www.example.com. 
   When you navigate to this URL, the web browser on your computer sends an HTTP request in the form of a text-based message.
   
   This request uses the GET method, which asks for data from the host server listed after Host:. In response to this request, the example.com web server returns an HTML    page to the requesting client, in addition to any images, stylesheets, or other resources called for in the HTML. Note that not all of the resources are returned to      the client in the first call for data. The requests and responses will go back and forth between the server and client until the web browser has received all the        resources necessary to render the contents of the HTML page on your screen. 
   
   You can think of this exchange of requests and responses as a single application layer of the internet protocol stack, sitting on top of the transfer layer (usually      using the Transmission Control Protocol, or TCP) and networking layers (using the Internet Protocol, or IP)
   
   HTTP 2 :
   
   HTTP/2 began as the SPDY protocol, developed primarily at Google with the intention of reducing web page load latency by using techniques such as compression,            multiplexing, and prioritization. This protocol served as a template for HTTP/2 when the Hypertext Transfer Protocol working group httpbis of the IETF (Internet          Engineering Task Force) put the standard together, culminating in the publication of HTTP/2 in May 2015. From the beginning, many browsers supported this                standardization effort, including Chrome, Opera, Internet Explorer, and Safari. 
   
   From a technical point of view, one of the most significant features that distinguishes HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 is the binary framing layer, which can be thought of as a    part of the application layer in the internet protocol stack. 
   
   As opposed to HTTP/1.1, which keeps all requests and responses in plain text format, HTTP/2 uses the binary framing layer to encapsulate all messages in binary          format, while still maintaining HTTP semantics, such as verbs, methods, and headers.
   
   An application level API would still create messages in the conventional HTTP formats, but the underlying layer would then convert these messages into binary. This      ensures that web applications created before HTTP/2 can continue functioning as normal when interacting with the new protocol.
   
   The conversion of messages into binary allows HTTP/2 to try new approaches to data delivery not available in HTTP/1.1, a contrast that is at the root of the practical    differences between the two protocols.
